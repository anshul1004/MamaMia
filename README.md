Added Registration UI page

Cart Page Feature added. User can go to the cart page and see the items in their cart. They can delete or increase quantity of the items in the cart.
Note that backend will only update when the Update Cart button is clicked. Otherwise even if the changes are present in UI it will not be reflected in the backend.

Issues:

In the list view of menu, ven we are near that menu item the drop screen anmation over image appears. Should remove this screen as its not used anywhere. 
pagination for search have to see. Search results are few but it still shows all 7 pages, with fixed item.
